Repository for my Go exercises and small crafts I've made to learn Go and test my knowledge.

Each folder represents a different topic, mostly each file is a completed exercise, but some are just a small piece of code that I've written to learn a new concept.

Several small projects I made for fun, mostly to learn Go and test my knowledge are also included.

- https://github.com/darkzarich/go-basics/tree/main/server_load_balancer - a simple HTTP server that can load balance requests between multiple backend servers
- https://github.com/darkzarich/go-basics/tree/main/simple-return-json-server - a simple HTTP server that returns JSON
- https://github.com/darkzarich/go-basics/tree/main/cats-server - basic CRUD operations on Cats
- `func` folder with `print_dirs....go` files - small functions to print the contents of a directory, more or less was a task but I wanted to do there something new
- https://github.com/darkzarich/go-basics/tree/main/png - just generates a PNG gradient
